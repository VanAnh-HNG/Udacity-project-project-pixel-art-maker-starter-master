# Pixel Art Maker Project

## About the project
This project was built for Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program.
The purpose is to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas. 

## Use instructions
1. Creating the canvas size by entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.
2. Choosing a color from the color selector.
3. Clicking on the grid square to change the color.
4. If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.
